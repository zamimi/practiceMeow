# This is my practice repository

This repository is really to indulge myself in coding. I, currently doing this, am not as experienced in coding despite being more than halfway through college. I want to slowly apply what I can learn on my own through this. I'll use this as a tracker too! Hopefully this is a helpful experience to myself.
